# Travelers App - Web and API

### will make a seperate repo for mobile soon after we make some headway here and decide on tech for the native app

- Install docker(&& docker-compose) if you haven't already
- client will run on http://localhost:8080 even though it says otherwise in terminal
- GraphQL API test page is at http://localhost:5000/graphql very cool tool, link in docker output to terminal also

To get started run the following command in root of the project

```
docker-compose up --build
```

To tear down after working

```
docker-compose down
```
